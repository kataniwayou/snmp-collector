# Project Milestones: SNMP Monitoring System

## v1.3 Grafana Dashboards (Shipped: 2026-03-09)

**Delivered:** Two purpose-built Grafana dashboard JSON files — an operations dashboard for pipeline health and pod observability, and a business dashboard with device-agnostic gauge and info metric tables with cascading filters, trend arrows, and copyable PromQL columns.

**Phases completed:** 18-19 (2 plans total, 9 quick tasks)

**Key accomplishments:**
- Operations dashboard: pod identity table, 11 pipeline counter panels, 6 .NET runtime panels, all filtered by host
- Business dashboard: gauge and info metric tables with 3 cascading filters (Host->Pod->Device)
- Trend column with delta-driven colored arrows showing value changes
- PromQL column with copyable query strings including host/pod labels
- Cell inspect enabled for full content viewing
- 9 quick tasks for iterative dashboard refinements

**Stats:**
- 53 files changed (7,379 insertions, 355 deletions)
- 2 phases, 2 plans, 9 quick tasks
- 2 days (2026-03-08 → 2026-03-09)
- 10/10 requirements satisfied
- 5/5 E2E flows verified

**Git range:** `v1.2` → `v1.3`

**What's next:** TBD — next milestone planning

## v1.2 Operational Enhancements (Shipped: 2026-03-08)

**Delivered:** K8s API watch for ConfigMap hot-reload with sub-second event delivery, DynamicPollScheduler for live device/poll reconfiguration, and full live UAT of 13 ConfigMap scenarios + watch reconnection against 3-replica cluster.

**Phases completed:** 15-16 (8 plans total, 5 quick tasks)

**Key accomplishments:**
- K8s API watch replaces file-based hot-reload — sub-second ConfigMap change detection
- Split OidMapWatcherService + DeviceWatcherService with independent reload locks
- DynamicPollScheduler reconciles Quartz jobs on device config changes (add/remove/reschedule)
- Full live UAT: 13 ConfigMap scenarios + watch reconnection verified against 3-replica cluster
- Operational cleanup: SiteOptions→PodIdentityOptions, removed redundant host/pod tags, IsHeartbeat flag

**Stats:**
- 30 files modified (2,207 insertions, 131 deletions)
- 4,937 LOC C# source + 4,318 LOC tests + 783 LOC Python simulators
- 2 phases, 8 plans, 5 quick tasks
- 1 day (2026-03-08)
- 138 tests passing
- 4/4 requirements satisfied

**Git range:** `v1.1` → `v1.2`

**What's next:** TBD — v2.0 planning (Grafana dashboards, SNMP table walk, alerting rules)

## v1.1 Device Simulation (Shipped: 2026-03-08)

**Delivered:** OID maps for OBP (24 OIDs) and NPB (68 OIDs) with JSONC documentation, realistic SNMP simulators with trap generation, and full K8s E2E integration with devices.json poll configuration.

**Phases completed:** 11-14 (10 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**
- OBP OID map (24 entries, 4 links) and NPB OID map (68 entries, 8 ports) with inline documentation
- OBP simulator with power random walk and StateChange traps for all 4 links
- NPB simulator with Counter64 traffic profiles and portLinkChange traps for 6 active ports
- DNS resolution in DeviceRegistry for K8s Service names + optional CommunityString override
- devices.json with 92 poll OIDs across both device types (10s interval)
- E2E verification script validating poll + trap metrics in Prometheus

**Stats:**
- 53 files created/modified
- 4,937 LOC C# source + 4,318 LOC tests + 783 LOC Python simulators
- 4 phases, 10 plans
- 1 day (2026-03-07)
- 138 tests passing
- 14/14 requirements satisfied

**Git range:** `18a0c9d` → `67e046b`

**What's next:** v1.2 Operational Enhancements — K8s API watch, dynamic config reload

## v1.0 Foundation (Shipped: 2026-03-07)

**Delivered:** K8s-native SNMP monitoring agent that receives traps, polls devices, resolves OIDs, and pushes metrics through OpenTelemetry to Prometheus with leader-gated export and graceful HA failover.

**Phases completed:** 1-10 (48 plans total, 16 quick tasks)

**Key accomplishments:**
- Full MediatR pipeline with 4-behavior chain dispatching to snmp_gauge and snmp_info instruments
- SNMP trap + poll ingestion with community string convention and Quartz scheduling
- Leader-gated metric export via K8s Lease API with near-instant failover
- Graceful 5-step shutdown and startup/readiness/liveness health probes
- Heartbeat loopback proving pipeline liveness without metric pollution
- Production 3-replica K8s deployment with OTel Collector push pipeline to Prometheus

**Stats:**
- 94 files (70 source + 24 test)
- 7,819 lines of C# (4,077 source + 3,742 test)
- 10 phases, 48 plans, 16 quick tasks
- 3 days from start to ship (Mar 4-7, 2026)
- 121 tests passing, 0 warnings
- 33 K8s manifests

**Git range:** `5163696 docs: initialize project` → `a02ab42 feat: suppress heartbeat metric export`

**What's next:** TBD — production deployment with real NPB/OBP devices, OID map population, Grafana dashboards
