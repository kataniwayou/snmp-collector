# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Every SNMP OID — from a trap or a poll — gets resolved, typed correctly, and pushed to Prometheus where it's queryable in Grafana within seconds.
**Current focus:** v1.4 E2E System Verification -- Phase 22 (E2E Test Execution)

## Current Position

Phase: 21 of 24 (Test Harness and Pipeline Counter Verification)
Plan: 02 of 02
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-03-09 -- Completed 21-02-PLAN.md (Pipeline counter scenarios)

Progress: [####################] 48/48 v1.0, 10/10 v1.1, 8/8 v1.2, 2/2 v1.3 | v1.4: [####......] 1/5 phases complete, 2/2 plans in phase 21

## Accumulated Context

### Key Architectural Facts

- MediatR 12.5.0 (MIT) -- do NOT upgrade to v13+ (RPL-1.5 license)
- Two-meter architecture: MeterName for all instances, LeaderMeterName for leader only
- Community string convention: Simetra.{DeviceName} for both auth and device identity
- Split config: simetra-oidmaps ConfigMap + simetra-devices ConfigMap + simetra-config
- K8s directory mount at /app/config (no subPath) enables ConfigMap hot-reload

### E2E Test Context (v1.4)

- OTel 15s export interval: poll-until-satisfied with 30s timeout, 3s interval (never fixed sleeps)
- Prometheus 5-min staleness: verify removal via label change or counter stagnation, never absence
- Counter assertions: cumulative temporality, use deltas filtered by device_name
- Leader election: business metrics (snmp_gauge/snmp_info) export from leader only; pipeline counters from all
- Test simulator uses enterprise OID subtree 47477.999, community Simetra.E2E-SIM
- Sequential test execution required (shared Prometheus state)

### Known Tech Debt

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
