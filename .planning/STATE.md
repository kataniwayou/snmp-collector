# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Every SNMP OID — from a trap or a poll — gets resolved, typed correctly, and pushed to Prometheus where it's queryable in Grafana within seconds.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining next milestone)
Plan: —
Status: v1.4 complete, ready for next milestone
Last activity: 2026-03-10 -- Completed quick-038 (configurable poll timeout percentage)

Progress: [####################] 48/48 v1.0, 10/10 v1.1, 8/8 v1.2, 2/2 v1.3, 11/11 v1.4

## Accumulated Context

### Key Architectural Facts

- MediatR 12.5.0 (MIT) -- do NOT upgrade to v13+ (RPL-1.5 license)
- Two-meter architecture: MeterName for all instances, LeaderMeterName for leader only
- Community string convention: Simetra.{DeviceName} for both auth and device identity
- Split config: simetra-oidmaps ConfigMap + simetra-devices ConfigMap + simetra-config
- K8s directory mount at /app/config (no subPath) enables ConfigMap hot-reload
- DeviceRegistry primary key: (IP, Port); secondary: Name (trap listener compatibility)
- Quartz job key format: metric-poll-{ip}_{port}-{pollIndex} (underscore separator)

### Known Tech Debt

None.
