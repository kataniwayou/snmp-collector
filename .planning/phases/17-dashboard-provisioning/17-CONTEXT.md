# Phase 17: Dashboard Provisioning - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-03-08
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Set up Grafana's file-based provisioning so the Prometheus datasource and dashboard JSON files load on Grafana startup. Manual deployment via kubectl apply — no automated ConfigMap watchers or controllers. Dashboard JSON files will be created manually by the user — Claude sets up the provisioning infrastructure and Grafana deployment wiring only.

## Implementation Decisions

### Existing files
- All files under `deploy/grafana/` are stale reference project artifacts — delete and replace entirely
- Old dashboards: `npb-device.json`, `obp-device.json`, `simetra-operations.json` — all invalid
- Old datasource: `simetra-prometheus.yaml` — will be recreated

### Provisioning approach
- Manual deployment only — kubectl apply, not automated ConfigMap watchers
- Grafana file-based provisioning (provisioning YAMLs point to dashboard directory)
- Datasource and dashboard provider configs mounted into Grafana container

### Dashboard JSON authoring
- User creates dashboard JSON files manually — Claude does NOT generate dashboard JSON
- Phases 18 and 19 are user-driven: user builds simetra-operations and simetra-business dashboards by hand
- Claude's role in Phase 17: provisioning infrastructure, datasource config, Grafana deployment wiring

### Dashboard lifecycle
- Dashboards deployed as files, loaded by Grafana on startup
- Updates require kubectl apply + Grafana pod restart (or rolling restart)
- No UI editing — provisioned dashboards are read-only in Grafana

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact Grafana volume mount paths and provisioning directory structure
- Whether to use ConfigMaps or direct file mounts for the provisioning configs
- Grafana deployment YAML modifications

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- User will manually create two dashboards: simetra-operations (Phase 18) and simetra-business (Phase 19)
- This phase should leave the dashboard directory ready for the user to drop JSON files into

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
