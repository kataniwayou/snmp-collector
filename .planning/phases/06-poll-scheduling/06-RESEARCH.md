# Phase 6: Poll Scheduling - Research

**Researched:** 2026-03-05
**Domain:** Quartz.NET 3.15.1 job scheduling, SharpSnmpLib 12.5.7 SNMP GET, MediatR ISender.Send, per-device failure tracking
**Confidence:** HIGH

---

## Summary

Phase 6 adds Quartz-driven SNMP GET polling to SnmpCollector. The goal is a `MetricPollJob` (Quartz `IJob` with `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]`) that fires per configured poll group, issues a single SNMP GET with all OIDs (plus sysUpTime prepended), dispatches each returned varbind individually via `ISender.Send()`, and marks devices unreachable after 3 consecutive failures — while continuing to poll on schedule for immediate recovery detection.

The Simetra reference project (`src/Simetra/Jobs/MetricPollJob.cs` and its scheduling extension) is the authoritative reference for this phase. It demonstrates the exact pattern needed: `UsingJobData` to pass `deviceName` and `intervalSeconds` through the `JobDataMap`, `CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource` with `CancelAfter(intervalSeconds * 0.8)` for timeout, and `Messenger.GetAsync()` with a `CancellationToken`. The Simetra reference uses `maxConcurrency: jobCount` (1:1 ratio) for thread pool sizing, which is the confirmed formula.

The key difference from the Simetra reference: SnmpCollector's poll job dispatches **directly to MediatR** (no channels, no intermediary service) — one `ISender.Send()` per varbind. The sysUpTime OID (`1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0`) must be prepended to every GET request so the counter delta engine gets uptime context atomically. Unreachability tracking lives in a `DeviceUnreachabilityTracker` singleton with `ConcurrentDictionary`-based per-device failure state.

**Primary recommendation:** Build `MetricPollJob` directly from the Simetra reference pattern, with these SnmpCollector-specific adaptations: (1) prepend sysUpTime OID to all GET requests, (2) dispatch via `ISender.Send()` directly instead of through channels, (3) add per-device consecutive failure tracking with `DeviceUnreachabilityTracker` singleton, (4) add two new counters to `PipelineMetricService` (`snmp.poll.unreachable`, `snmp.poll.recovered`).

## Standard Stack

### Core

| Library | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Quartz.Extensions.Hosting | 3.15.1 | `IJob`, `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]`, `AddQuartz`, `UseDefaultThreadPool`, `JobDataMap` | Already in `SnmpCollector.csproj`; Quartz job infrastructure locked by project |
| Lextm.SharpSnmpLib | 12.5.7 | `Messenger.GetAsync()`, `VersionCode.V2`, `OctetString`, `Variable`, `ObjectIdentifier` | Already in project; SNMP GET is the polling mechanism |
| MediatR | 12.5.0 | `ISender.Send()` — dispatches each varbind through behavior pipeline | Already in project; ISender is the only dispatch path |

### No New Packages Required

Phase 6 adds no new NuGet references. All required packages are already in `SnmpCollector.csproj`.

### Supporting

| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `System.Collections.Concurrent` | BCL (.NET 9) | `ConcurrentDictionary<string, DeviceState>` for per-device failure counters | In `DeviceUnreachabilityTracker` singleton |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` | 9.0.0 | `ILogger<MetricPollJob>` for Warning/Information logging | Already in project; used for timeout warnings, unreachability transitions |

### Alternatives Considered

| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| `Messenger.GetAsync()` | `Messenger.GetBulkAsync()` | GetBulk retrieves up to N OIDs per packet (SNMPv2c feature), but with a fixed OID list per poll group, regular GET is simpler and more predictable |
| `ConcurrentDictionary` in singleton tracker | Per-job instance field | Singleton tracker survives across job executions; per-job field is lost because Quartz DI creates a new job instance per execution |
| Separate `DeviceUnreachabilityTracker` singleton | Inline failure count in `MetricPollJob` | Separate service keeps job lean and makes unit testing easier |

```

### Pattern 1: MetricPollJob with DisallowConcurrentExecution

**What:** Quartz `IJob` decorated with `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]`. When a trigger fires while the previous execution is still running, Quartz skips the fire (misfire) rather than queuing a second execution. This prevents pile-up when a slow device holds the job for the full interval.

**When to use:** Any job that should not have overlapping executions for the same job key. Since each device/pollIndex combination is its own job key (`metric-poll-{deviceName}-{pollIndex}`), `DisallowConcurrentExecution` means: "this specific device's this specific poll group cannot execute twice simultaneously."

**From the Simetra reference (read directly — HIGH confidence):**

```csharp
// Source: src/Simetra/Jobs/MetricPollJob.cs
[DisallowConcurrentExecution]
public sealed class MetricPollJob : IJob
{
    // ... DI constructor injection

    public async Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)
    {
        var deviceName = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetString("deviceName")!;
        var intervalSeconds = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetInt("intervalSeconds");
        var pollIndex = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetInt("pollIndex");  // SnmpCollector uses int index

        // ...

        using var timeoutCts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(
            context.CancellationToken);
        timeoutCts.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(intervalSeconds * 0.8));

        IList<Variable> response = await Messenger.GetAsync(
            VersionCode.V2,
            endpoint,
            community,
            variables,
            timeoutCts.Token);

        // ... dispatch each variable via ISender.Send()
    }
}
```

**SnmpCollector adaptations from the Simetra reference:**
- Replace `pollKey` (string) with `pollIndex` (int) — SnmpCollector uses index-based poll group identity
- Replace `_extractor.Extract()` + `_coordinator.Process()` with direct `ISender.Send()` per varbind
- Remove `_pollRegistry` dependency — OIDs come from `DeviceInfo.PollGroups[pollIndex].Oids` (DeviceRegistry already has them)
- Remove `ILivenessVectorService` — Phase 8 concern, not yet needed
- Add sysUpTime OID prepend
- Add `DeviceUnreachabilityTracker` for failure tracking

### Pattern 2: JobDataMap for Device/Poll Identity

**What:** Pass `deviceName`, `pollIndex`, and `intervalSeconds` through Quartz's `JobDataMap` so the job can look up the device and poll group at execution time.

**Why `deviceName` and `pollIndex` instead of embedding the OID list:** The OID list lives in `DeviceRegistry` (already loaded at startup). Passing the lookup key keeps the `JobDataMap` small and avoids serializing potentially large OID arrays. The job resolves the full `DeviceInfo` at execution time.

```csharp
// Source: src/Simetra/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs (adapted for SnmpCollector)
var jobKey = new JobKey($"metric-poll-{device.Name}-{pollGroup.PollIndex}");
q.AddJob<MetricPollJob>(j => j
    .WithIdentity(jobKey)
    .UsingJobData("deviceName", device.Name)
    .UsingJobData("pollIndex", pollGroup.PollIndex)
    .UsingJobData("intervalSeconds", pollGroup.IntervalSeconds));

q.AddTrigger(t => t
    .ForJob(jobKey)
    .WithIdentity($"metric-poll-{device.Name}-{pollGroup.PollIndex}-trigger")
    .StartNow()
    .WithSimpleSchedule(s => s
        .WithIntervalInSeconds(pollGroup.IntervalSeconds)
        .RepeatForever()
        .WithMisfireHandlingInstructionNextWithRemainingCount()));
```

**JobDataMap access in Execute:**
```csharp
var deviceName = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetString("deviceName")!;
var pollIndex = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetInt("pollIndex");
var intervalSeconds = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetInt("intervalSeconds");
```

### Pattern 3: Thread Pool Sizing Formula

**What:** `maxConcurrency` should equal the total job count so every job can run simultaneously when all polls fire at the same second.

**Verified from Simetra reference (read directly — HIGH confidence):**
```csharp
// Source: src/Simetra/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:416-427
// Formula: start with static job count, add all dynamic jobs
var jobCount = 1; // correlation job (Phase 6; no heartbeat yet)
foreach (var device in devicesOptions.Devices)
{
    jobCount += device.MetricPolls.Count; // one job per poll group
}

services.AddQuartz(q =>
{
    q.UseInMemoryStore();
    q.UseDefaultThreadPool(maxConcurrency: jobCount);
    // ...
});
```

**For SnmpCollector Phase 6:**
- Static jobs: 1 (CorrelationJob already registered)
- Dynamic jobs: sum of `device.MetricPolls.Count` across all devices
- Formula: `jobCount = 1 + devices.Sum(d => d.MetricPolls.Count)`

**Why 1:1 ratio works:** With `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]`, each job occupies a thread only during its active SNMP GET + dispatch window. Even if all polls fire simultaneously at the start of a new interval, the thread pool of `jobCount` ensures every job gets a thread immediately. The Quartz `DefaultThreadPool` dispatches tasks to the .NET thread pool — tasks exceeding `maxConcurrency` wait for an available slot. Setting `maxConcurrency = jobCount` prevents any job from waiting.

**Startup log (locked decision):**
```csharp
_logger.LogInformation(
    "Registered {N} poll jobs across {M} devices, thread pool size: {T}",
    jobCount - 1,  // subtract CorrelationJob
    devicesOptions.Devices.Count,
    jobCount);
```

### Pattern 4: SNMP GET with sysUpTime Prepend

**What:** sysUpTime OID (`1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0`) is prepended to the OID list for every GET request. The response is parsed: if a variable has OID `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0` and type `TimeTicks`, extract its value as `SysUpTimeCentiseconds` and set it on all subsequent `SnmpOidReceived` messages from the same poll. sysUpTime itself is also dispatched as a regular varbind (it's in the OID map as `"sysUpTime"`).

**Why sysUpTime first in the list:** SNMP GET responses return variables in the same order as the request. Prepending ensures the sysUpTime value is atomically bundled with the metric values in the same GET response — no separate GET needed.

**SharpSnmpLib API — verified (HIGH confidence):**
```csharp
// Source: src/Simetra/Jobs/MetricPollJob.cs (adapted) — HIGH confidence
private const string SysUpTimeOid = "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0";

// Build request variable list: sysUpTime first, then poll group OIDs
var variables = new List<Variable>
{
    new Variable(new ObjectIdentifier(SysUpTimeOid))
};
variables.AddRange(pollGroup.Oids.Select(oid =>
    new Variable(new ObjectIdentifier(oid))));

var endpoint = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(device.IpAddress), 161);
var community = new OctetString(device.CommunityString);

using var timeoutCts = CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(
    context.CancellationToken);
timeoutCts.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(intervalSeconds * 0.8));

IList<Variable> response = await Messenger.GetAsync(
    VersionCode.V2,
    endpoint,
    community,
    variables,
    timeoutCts.Token);
```

**Extracting sysUpTime and dispatching all varbinds:**
```csharp
uint? sysUpTime = null;
foreach (var variable in response)
{
    // Extract sysUpTime if present — also dispatch as a regular varbind
    if (variable.Id.ToString() == SysUpTimeOid
        && variable.Data.TypeCode == SnmpType.TimeTicks)
    {
        sysUpTime = ((TimeTicks)variable.Data).ToUInt32();
        // Fall through — dispatch sysUpTime as a gauge too (it's in the OID map)
    }

    // Skip SNMP error types
    if (variable.Data.TypeCode is SnmpType.NoSuchObject
        or SnmpType.NoSuchInstance
        or SnmpType.EndOfMibView)
    {
        _logger.LogDebug(
            "OID {Oid} returned {TypeCode} from {DeviceName} — skipping",
            variable.Id.ToString(), variable.Data.TypeCode, device.Name);
        continue;
    }

    var msg = new SnmpOidReceived
    {
        Oid        = variable.Id.ToString(),
        AgentIp    = IPAddress.Parse(device.IpAddress),
        DeviceName = device.Name,
        Value      = variable.Data,
        Source     = SnmpSource.Poll,
        TypeCode   = variable.Data.TypeCode,
        SysUpTimeCentiseconds = sysUpTime,  // null for sysUpTime itself; set for subsequent OIDs
    };
    await _sender.Send(msg, context.CancellationToken);
}
```

**`TimeTicks.ToUInt32()` API — HIGH confidence:**
Verified from SharpSnmpLib official docs: `TimeTicks.ToUInt32()` returns the centiseconds count as `uint`. The internal storage is `Counter32 _count` where each unit is one centisecond. `ToTimeSpan()` multiplies by 100,000 to convert to .NET ticks. `ToUInt32()` is the correct method to call.

### Pattern 5: DeviceUnreachabilityTracker Singleton

**What:** A singleton service that tracks consecutive failure counts per device and detects unreachable/recovered transitions.

**Why a singleton:** Quartz DI creates a new job instance per execution. Any state stored in job instance fields is lost between executions. A singleton tracker ensures the count accumulates correctly across invocations.

**Interface:**
```csharp
// New file: src/SnmpCollector/Pipeline/IDeviceUnreachabilityTracker.cs
namespace SnmpCollector.Pipeline;

/// <summary>
/// Tracks consecutive poll failures per device for unreachability detection.
/// Thread-safe: multiple jobs may call simultaneously (different devices).
/// </summary>
public interface IDeviceUnreachabilityTracker
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Record a poll failure for the device. Returns true on the TRANSITION to unreachable
    /// (i.e., the Nth consecutive failure where N == threshold). Returns false otherwise.
    /// </summary>
    bool RecordFailure(string deviceName);

    /// <summary>
    /// Record a poll success for the device. Returns true on TRANSITION from unreachable to
    /// healthy (i.e., device was marked unreachable, now recovered). Returns false if device
    /// was already healthy.
    /// </summary>
    bool RecordSuccess(string deviceName);

    /// <summary>Returns the current consecutive failure count for the device.</summary>
    int GetFailureCount(string deviceName);

    /// <summary>Returns true if the device is currently in the unreachable state.</summary>
    bool IsUnreachable(string deviceName);
}
```

**Implementation using class-based inner state (avoiding struct-in-ConcurrentDictionary atomicity issues):**
```csharp
// New file: src/SnmpCollector/Pipeline/DeviceUnreachabilityTracker.cs
public sealed class DeviceUnreachabilityTracker : IDeviceUnreachabilityTracker
{
    private readonly int _threshold = 3;  // hardcoded per locked decision

    // StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase: device names are user-configured; case may vary
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, DeviceState> _state = new(
        StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

    public bool RecordFailure(string deviceName)
    {
        var state = _state.GetOrAdd(deviceName, _ => new DeviceState());
        return state.RecordFailure(_threshold);
    }

    public bool RecordSuccess(string deviceName)
    {
        var state = _state.GetOrAdd(deviceName, _ => new DeviceState());
        return state.RecordSuccess();
    }

    public int GetFailureCount(string deviceName)
        => _state.TryGetValue(deviceName, out var state) ? state.Count : 0;

    public bool IsUnreachable(string deviceName)
        => _state.TryGetValue(deviceName, out var state) && state.IsUnreachable;

    // Inner class to avoid ConcurrentDictionary struct-update atomicity issues
    private sealed class DeviceState
    {
        private volatile int _count;
        private volatile bool _isUnreachable;

        public int Count => _count;
        public bool IsUnreachable => _isUnreachable;

        public bool RecordFailure(int threshold)
        {
            var newCount = Interlocked.Increment(ref _count);
            if (newCount >= threshold && !_isUnreachable)
            {
                _isUnreachable = true;
                return true;  // transition to unreachable
            }
            return false;
        }

        public bool RecordSuccess()
        {
            Interlocked.Exchange(ref _count, 0);
            if (_isUnreachable)
            {
                _isUnreachable = false;
                return true;  // transition to recovered
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

**Concurrency note:** With `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]`, two executions of the same device's poll job cannot run simultaneously, so `RecordFailure` and `RecordSuccess` are not called concurrently for the same device. The `volatile int` + `Interlocked.Increment` pattern is still correct defensive practice for the shared singleton.

### Pattern 6: Failure/Recovery Logging and Counter Increments

**What:** When a device transitions to unreachable, log at Warning and increment `snmp.poll.unreachable`. When it recovers, log at Information and increment `snmp.poll.recovered`. Log only on transition — not on every failure once unreachable.

**Locked decisions from CONTEXT.md:**
- Unreachable log: `"Device {Name} ({Ip}) unreachable after {N} consecutive failures"`
- Recovery log: `"Device {Name} ({Ip}) recovered"` at Information level
- Counter per event: `snmp.poll.unreachable` on transition to unreachable, `snmp.poll.recovered` on transition back to healthy

**PipelineMetricService additions (two new counters):**
```csharp
// Add to existing PipelineMetricService:
private readonly Counter<long> _pollUnreachable;
private readonly Counter<long> _pollRecovered;

// In constructor:
_pollUnreachable = _meter.CreateCounter<long>("snmp.poll.unreachable");
_pollRecovered   = _meter.CreateCounter<long>("snmp.poll.recovered");

// New public methods:
public void IncrementPollUnreachable()
    => _pollUnreachable.Add(1, new TagList { { "site_name", _siteName } });

public void IncrementPollRecovered()
    => _pollRecovered.Add(1, new TagList { { "site_name", _siteName } });
```

### Pattern 7: Timeout and Failure Handling in Execute

**What:** The job must distinguish three failure modes: (1) timeout (`OperationCanceledException` from the 80%-of-interval CTS, not from the host shutdown CTS), (2) network/SNMP error (`Exception`), (3) successful poll. All failure modes increment `snmp.poll.executed` (locked: "after every completed poll regardless of success/failure"). Device-not-found is an early-return before the `try` and does NOT increment the counter.

**Complete Execute structure:**
```csharp
public async Task Execute(IJobExecutionContext context)
{
    var jobKey = context.JobDetail.Key.Name;
    var deviceName = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetString("deviceName")!;
    var pollIndex = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetInt("pollIndex");
    var intervalSeconds = context.MergedJobDataMap.GetInt("intervalSeconds");

    // Device lookup — config error if not found; return WITHOUT incrementing snmp.poll.executed
    if (!_deviceRegistry.TryGetDeviceByName(deviceName, out var device))
    {
        _logger.LogWarning(
            "Poll job {JobKey}: device {DeviceName} not found in registry",
            jobKey, deviceName);
        return;
    }

    var pollGroup = device.PollGroups[pollIndex];

    try
    {
        // ... build variables, create timeout CTS, call Messenger.GetAsync ...
        // ... dispatch each varbind via DispatchResponseAsync ...

        // On success: reset failure counter, detect recovery
        if (_unreachabilityTracker.RecordSuccess(deviceName))
        {
            _logger.LogInformation(
                "Device {Name} ({Ip}) recovered",
                device.Name, device.IpAddress);
            _pipelineMetrics.IncrementPollRecovered();
        }
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException) when (!context.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        // Timeout (80% of interval elapsed) — NOT host shutdown
        _logger.LogWarning(
            "Poll job {JobKey} timed out waiting for SNMP response",
            jobKey);
        RecordFailure(deviceName, device);
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        throw;  // Host shutdown — do not swallow; let Quartz handle it
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Network error, SNMP protocol error, etc.
        _logger.LogWarning(ex,
            "Poll job {JobKey} failed: {Message}", jobKey, ex.Message);
        RecordFailure(deviceName, device);
    }
    finally
    {
        _pipelineMetrics.IncrementPollExecuted();  // always, per SC#4
    }
}

private void RecordFailure(string deviceName, DeviceInfo device)
{
    if (_unreachabilityTracker.RecordFailure(deviceName))
    {
        var failureCount = _unreachabilityTracker.GetFailureCount(deviceName);
        _logger.LogWarning(
            "Device {Name} ({Ip}) unreachable after {N} consecutive failures",
            device.Name, device.IpAddress, failureCount);
        _pipelineMetrics.IncrementPollUnreachable();
    }
}
```

**Key: `when (!context.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)`** is the correct guard to distinguish timeout (the linked timeout CTS fired) from host shutdown (`context.CancellationToken` fired). This pattern is from the Simetra reference (read directly — HIGH confidence).

### Pattern 8: noSuchObject / noSuchInstance Handling

**What:** When a device returns `noSuchObject` (SnmpType 128) or `noSuchInstance` (SnmpType 129) for an OID, the variable is still present in the response but with an error type code. These should be skipped silently with a Debug log.

**CONTEXT.md decision:** "Claude's Discretion."

**Recommendation:** Skip at the job level before `ISender.Send()`. Dispatching them would reach `OtelMetricHandler` which has no case for TypeCode 128 or 129 — they would produce no metric but would still run through the full behavior chain unnecessarily. Silently skipping is consistent with "partial responses: publish what we got" (the device's usable OIDs are still dispatched).

```csharp
// In response processing loop — check BEFORE building SnmpOidReceived:
if (variable.Data.TypeCode is SnmpType.NoSuchObject
    or SnmpType.NoSuchInstance
    or SnmpType.EndOfMibView)
{
    _logger.LogDebug(
        "OID {Oid} returned {TypeCode} from {DeviceName} — skipping",
        variable.Id.ToString(), variable.Data.TypeCode, device.Name);
    continue;
}
```

`variable.Data` is never null in SharpSnmpLib 12.5.7 GET responses — `noSuchObject`/`noSuchInstance` are `ISnmpData` instances with TypeCode 128/129, not null references.

### Pattern 9: AddSnmpScheduling Modification

**What:** Extend the existing `AddSnmpScheduling()` in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` to register the `DeviceUnreachabilityTracker`, update the thread pool size, and register a `MetricPollJob` for each device/poll group.

**Critical:** `devicesOptions` must be read from `IConfiguration` directly (not via `IOptions<>`) because the `AddQuartz` lambda runs during host building, before the DI container is built. This matches the existing pattern already used in `AddSnmpScheduling` for `CorrelationJobOptions`.

```csharp
public static IServiceCollection AddSnmpScheduling(
    this IServiceCollection services,
    IConfiguration configuration)
{
    // ICorrelationService (existing)
    services.AddSingleton<ICorrelationService, RotatingCorrelationService>();

    // Phase 6: Unreachability tracker singleton
    services.AddSingleton<IDeviceUnreachabilityTracker, DeviceUnreachabilityTracker>();

    // Bind options directly (DI not built yet — cannot use IOptions<T>)
    var devicesOptions = new DevicesOptions();
    configuration.GetSection(DevicesOptions.SectionName).Bind(devicesOptions.Devices);

    var correlationOptions = new CorrelationJobOptions();
    configuration.GetSection(CorrelationJobOptions.SectionName).Bind(correlationOptions);

    // Calculate total job count: 1 correlation + all poll groups
    var jobCount = 1; // CorrelationJob
    foreach (var device in devicesOptions.Devices)
        jobCount += device.MetricPolls.Count;

    services.AddQuartz(q =>
    {
        q.UseInMemoryStore();
        q.UseDefaultThreadPool(maxConcurrency: jobCount);  // Phase 6 — updated from default 10

        // CorrelationJob (existing, unchanged)
        var correlationKey = new JobKey("correlation");
        q.AddJob<CorrelationJob>(j => j.WithIdentity(correlationKey));
        q.AddTrigger(t => t
            .ForJob(correlationKey)
            .WithIdentity("correlation-trigger")
            .StartNow()
            .WithSimpleSchedule(s => s
                .WithIntervalInSeconds(correlationOptions.IntervalSeconds)
                .RepeatForever()
                .WithMisfireHandlingInstructionNextWithRemainingCount()));

        // Dynamic: MetricPollJob per device per poll group
        for (var di = 0; di < devicesOptions.Devices.Count; di++)
        {
            var device = devicesOptions.Devices[di];
            for (var pi = 0; pi < device.MetricPolls.Count; pi++)
            {
                var poll = device.MetricPolls[pi];
                var jobKey = new JobKey($"metric-poll-{device.Name}-{pi}");
                q.AddJob<MetricPollJob>(j => j
                    .WithIdentity(jobKey)
                    .UsingJobData("deviceName", device.Name)
                    .UsingJobData("pollIndex", pi)
                    .UsingJobData("intervalSeconds", poll.IntervalSeconds));

                q.AddTrigger(t => t
                    .ForJob(jobKey)
                    .WithIdentity($"metric-poll-{device.Name}-{pi}-trigger")
                    .StartNow()
                    .WithSimpleSchedule(s => s
                        .WithIntervalInSeconds(poll.IntervalSeconds)
                        .RepeatForever()
                        .WithMisfireHandlingInstructionNextWithRemainingCount()));
            }
        }
    });

    services.AddQuartzHostedService(options =>
    {
        options.WaitForJobsToComplete = true;
    });

    return services;
}
```

**Startup log placement:** The "Registered {N} poll jobs..." log belongs in a small `PollSchedulerStartupService : IHostedService`. It injects `IDeviceRegistry`, reads `AllDevices` at `StartAsync`, sums `PollGroups.Count` across devices, and logs at Information. Register it in `AddSnmpScheduling` after `AddQuartzHostedService`. This avoids the "ILogger not available during DI registration" problem.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Using `IPublisher.Publish()` instead of `ISender.Send()`:** `SnmpOidReceived : IRequest<Unit>`, not `INotification`. `IPublisher.Publish()` bypasses all `IPipelineBehavior` behaviors — no logging, no validation, no OID resolution. Always use `ISender.Send()`.
- **Not linking the timeout CTS to `context.CancellationToken`:** If only a standalone `CancellationTokenSource` is used for the timeout, host shutdown will not cancel the SNMP GET. Always use `CreateLinkedTokenSource(context.CancellationToken)`.
- **Catching `OperationCanceledException` without checking `context.CancellationToken`:** Catching all `OperationCanceledException` and treating them as timeouts will suppress host shutdown signals. The `when (!context.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)` guard is mandatory.
- **Setting `maxConcurrency` to a hardcoded constant:** The number of jobs changes when devices are added to config. Always calculate from the actual job count at registration time.
- **Dispatching `noSuchObject`/`noSuchInstance` varbinds:** These are SNMP protocol-level error types (SnmpType 128, 129). `OtelMetricHandler` has no case for them. Skip at the job level.
- **Storing per-device failure state in the job instance:** Quartz DI creates a new instance per execution (scoped lifetime default). Use a singleton tracker.
- **Setting `DeviceName = null` on `SnmpOidReceived`:** The poll job knows the device name at construction from `JobDataMap`. Always set `DeviceName = device.Name` on every constructed `SnmpOidReceived`.
- **Using `WithMisfireHandlingInstructionDoNothing()` on a `SimpleTrigger`:** `DoNothing` is only valid on `CronTrigger`. On `SimpleTrigger`, use `WithMisfireHandlingInstructionNextWithRemainingCount()` — for `RepeatForever` triggers, this provides semantics equivalent to "skip missed fires, wait for next."

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| SNMP GET with timeout | Manual UDP socket with select() | `Messenger.GetAsync(token)` + `CancelAfter()` | `Messenger.GetAsync` handles request ID, response matching, retry; CancellationToken propagates cleanly |
| Concurrent execution prevention | Lock per job key | `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]` on `IJob` | Quartz-native attribute; lock approach would deadlock if the job takes longer than the interval |
| Thread pool for jobs | `ThreadPool.SetMinThreads()` | `q.UseDefaultThreadPool(maxConcurrency: N)` | Quartz's pool governs job scheduling concurrency independently from .NET ThreadPool |
| Per-device failure count | Per-job instance field | `ConcurrentDictionary` in singleton tracker | Job instances are recreated by Quartz DI per execution; singleton persists across invocations |
| Partial response handling | Filtering at pipeline level | Skip at job level before `ISender.Send()` | Avoids unnecessary `ISender.Send()` calls for error-type varbinds that will produce no metric |

**Key insight:** The Simetra reference project already solved this exact problem. Read `src/Simetra/Jobs/MetricPollJob.cs` and `src/Simetra/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` (the `AddScheduling` method) before writing any new code. The SnmpCollector implementation is a simplification of the reference — fewer dependencies, direct `ISender.Send()` instead of extractor+coordinator, no liveness vector.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: OperationCanceledException Catch Ordering

**What goes wrong:** A single `catch (OperationCanceledException)` that treats all cancellations as timeouts. Host shutdown sends cancellation via `context.CancellationToken` — catching it as a "timeout" prevents Quartz from cleanly terminating the job.

**Why it happens:** Both timeout and shutdown throw `OperationCanceledException`. Without the `when` guard, they're indistinguishable.

**How to avoid:**
```csharp
// CORRECT: two separate catch blocks with guard
catch (OperationCanceledException) when (!context.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
    // Timeout — log Warning, record failure, continue
}
catch (OperationCanceledException)
{
    // Host shutdown — rethrow
    throw;
}
```

**Warning signs:** Application takes longer than expected to shut down; Quartz logs "job did not complete during shutdown" warnings.

### Pitfall 2: DevicesOptions Binding in AddSnmpScheduling

**What goes wrong:** Trying to use `IOptions<DevicesOptions>` inside `AddSnmpScheduling()` to iterate devices for job registration. The DI container is not yet built when `AddQuartz` lambda executes — `IOptions<T>` cannot be resolved via `GetRequiredService`.

**Why it happens:** `services.AddQuartz(q => {...})` is a configuration callback that runs during host building, before the DI container is built.

**How to avoid:** Bind directly from `IConfiguration`:
```csharp
var devicesOptions = new DevicesOptions();
configuration.GetSection(DevicesOptions.SectionName).Bind(devicesOptions.Devices);
```
This is the existing pattern already used in `AddSnmpScheduling` for `CorrelationJobOptions`. Verified from `src/Simetra/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` (read directly — HIGH confidence).

### Pitfall 3: SimpleTrigger Misfire — NextWithRemainingCount Only

**What goes wrong:** Using `WithMisfireHandlingInstructionDoNothing()` on a `SimpleTrigger`. `DoNothing` is only available on `CronTrigger`, not `SimpleTrigger`.

**Why it happens:** The misfire instruction names differ between trigger types. "DoNothing" sounds correct for "skip missed fires," but calling it on a `SimpleTrigger` throws a runtime exception.

**How to avoid:** On all `SimpleTrigger` (`WithSimpleSchedule()`), use:
```csharp
.WithMisfireHandlingInstructionNextWithRemainingCount()
```
For indefinite `RepeatForever` triggers, this provides semantics equivalent to "skip missed fires, wait for next scheduled time." Verified from Simetra reference code comment (SCHED-10 annotation in source).

### Pitfall 4: Job Instance Lifecycle (Scoped vs Singleton)

**What goes wrong:** Storing mutable state in a `MetricPollJob` instance field, expecting it to persist between executions. Quartz's .NET DI integration creates a new instance per execution (scoped lifetime by default).

**Why it happens:** In Quartz's Java origins, jobs are re-created per execution. The .NET `Quartz.Extensions.Hosting` follows this pattern.

**How to avoid:** Keep `MetricPollJob` fields to injected services only (all singletons from DI). Any state that must persist between executions belongs in a singleton service.

### Pitfall 5: sysUpTime OID Must Be in the OID Map

**What goes wrong:** Prepending sysUpTime OID to every GET request, then dispatching it as a regular `SnmpOidReceived`. If `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0` is not in the OID map, `OidResolutionBehavior` sets `MetricName = "Unknown"`. The sysUpTime value would appear in Prometheus as `metric_name="Unknown"`, polluting the Unknown bucket.

**How to avoid:** sysUpTime (`1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0`) is already mapped as `"sysUpTime"` in `appsettings.Development.json`. Ensure it's present in production `OidMap` config. This is already there in the development config — just ensure production config doesn't omit it.

### Pitfall 6: noSuchObject varbinds Have Non-null Data

**What goes wrong:** Null-checking `variable.Data` expecting null for error responses. In SharpSnmpLib 12.5.7, `noSuchObject` and `noSuchInstance` are represented as `ISnmpData` instances with `TypeCode` 128 and 129 — not as null.

**How to avoid:** Check TypeCode, not null:
```csharp
if (variable.Data.TypeCode is SnmpType.NoSuchObject or SnmpType.NoSuchInstance or SnmpType.EndOfMibView)
    continue;
```
Do NOT null-check `variable.Data`. Verified from SharpSnmpLib official `SnmpType` enum docs (HIGH confidence).

### Pitfall 7: DeviceRegistry Lookup Failure in Execute

**What goes wrong:** Incrementing `snmp.poll.executed` even when the device lookup fails inside `Execute`. A device-not-found condition means the job did nothing — counting it as "executed" inflates the metric with no corresponding output.

**How to avoid:** Perform the device lookup before the `try` block. On not-found, log Warning and `return` without entering the `try/finally` block. The `snmp.poll.executed` counter only increments in the `finally` of the main try, which is only reached when the job attempts a real poll.

### Pitfall 8: Lambda Capture in for Loop for JobKey

**What goes wrong:** Using `foreach` with a lambda that captures the loop variable. In a `foreach` over `device.MetricPolls`, the lambda inside `AddJob` or `AddTrigger` captures the variable by reference — by the time the lambda executes, all iterations have completed and every job uses the last poll's values.

**How to avoid:** Use an indexed `for` loop so the index is a local value type, not a captured reference variable:
```csharp
for (var pi = 0; pi < device.MetricPolls.Count; pi++)
{
    var poll = device.MetricPolls[pi];  // local variable — captured correctly
    // ... UsingJobData("pollIndex", pi)
}
```
Alternatively, capture explicitly: `var capturedPollIndex = pollIndex;` before the lambda.

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Quartz `JobChainingJobListener` for dependencies | Independent jobs per poll group, all `RepeatForever` | Quartz 3.x | No job chaining needed; each poll group is fully independent |
| `Quartz.Simpl.DefaultThreadPool` with literal OS threads | `DefaultThreadPool` backed by .NET `ThreadPool` (task-based semaphore) | Quartz 3.x | Thread count = task semaphore count, not literal threads; lighter weight |
| Manual SNMP request/response matching | `Messenger.GetAsync(token)` | SharpSnmpLib 8.x+ | CancellationToken support; request ID matching is internal |
| `WithMisfireHandlingInstructionDoNothing()` on SimpleTrigger | `WithMisfireHandlingInstructionNextWithRemainingCount()` | Always: DoNothing is CronTrigger only | Runtime exception if incorrectly used on SimpleTrigger |

**Current and verified (HIGH confidence):**
- Quartz 3.15.1 `UseDefaultThreadPool(maxConcurrency: N)` — confirmed from reference code and Quartz configuration docs
- `Messenger.GetAsync(VersionCode.V2, endpoint, community, variables, token)` — confirmed from SharpSnmpLib official API docs
- `SnmpType.NoSuchObject = 128`, `SnmpType.NoSuchInstance = 129` — confirmed from SharpSnmpLib official SnmpType enum docs
- `TimeTicks.ToUInt32()` returns centiseconds as uint — confirmed from SharpSnmpLib official TimeTicks class docs

---

## Open Questions

1. **`OperationCanceledException` as the exception from `Messenger.GetAsync` on timeout**
   - What we know: The Simetra reference uses `catch (OperationCanceledException) when (!context.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)` for SNMP timeout. SharpSnmpLib issues confirm CancellationToken support was added. .NET CancellationToken semantics guarantee `OperationCanceledException` on cancellation.
   - What's unclear: SharpSnmpLib official docs do not explicitly state the exception type. One GitHub gist shows `TaskCanceledException` (a subclass of `OperationCanceledException`).
   - Recommendation: The `when` guard pattern from the Simetra reference covers both `OperationCanceledException` and `TaskCanceledException` (since `TaskCanceledException` extends `OperationCanceledException`). Use the pattern as-is. MEDIUM confidence — the Simetra reference works in production, and the .NET type hierarchy makes both exceptions catchable by the same guard.

2. **sysUpTime dispatch: is the OID sent before or after setting SysUpTimeCentiseconds?**
   - What we know: The response loop iterates in request order. sysUpTime is first. We set `sysUpTime` when we encounter the sysUpTime variable, then fall through to dispatch it as a varbind. The `SysUpTimeCentiseconds` field on the sysUpTime varbind's own `SnmpOidReceived` will be `null` (not yet extracted).
   - Resolution: This is fine. sysUpTime is a `TimeTicks` gauge — `OtelMetricHandler` records its raw value to `snmp_gauge`. The `SysUpTimeCentiseconds` field is only used by the delta engine for `Counter32`/`Counter64` types. Setting it to `null` on the sysUpTime message itself is correct — no counter uses sysUpTime's own uptime context.

- [SharpSnmpLib SnmpType Enum](https://help.sharpsnmp.com/html/T_Lextm_SharpSnmpLib_SnmpType.htm) — `NoSuchObject = 128`, `NoSuchInstance = 129`, `EndOfMibView = 130`
- [SharpSnmpLib Messenger.GetAsync](https://help.sharpsnmp.com/html/M_Lextm_SharpSnmpLib_Messaging_Messenger_GetAsync.htm) — Method signature with CancellationToken overload
- [SharpSnmpLib TimeTicks](https://help.sharpsnmp.com/html/T_Lextm_SharpSnmpLib_TimeTicks.htm) — `ToUInt32()` returns centiseconds as uint; `ToTimeSpan()` for TimeSpan conversion

### Secondary (MEDIUM confidence)

- `src/SnmpCollector/Configuration/DeviceOptions.cs` — `MetricPolls: List<MetricPollOptions>`, iteration pattern (read directly)
- `src/SnmpCollector/Configuration/MetricPollOptions.cs` — `Oids: List<string>`, `IntervalSeconds: int` (read directly)
- [Quartz.NET Microsoft DI Integration](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/documentation/quartz-3.x/packages/microsoft-di-integration.html) — `UsingJobData` API pattern
- `OperationCanceledException` as exception type from `Messenger.GetAsync` on timeout — inferred from .NET CancellationToken semantics, Simetra reference pattern, and SharpSnmpLib GitHub issues #74

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)

- None remaining — all critical items have been verified.

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH — all packages already in project; no new dependencies needed
- Architecture: HIGH — Simetra reference implementation read directly; all patterns verified from production code
- Pitfalls: HIGH — most derived from direct reference code reading and verified API docs
- Thread pool formula: HIGH — read directly from Simetra reference (`jobCount` variable, `UseDefaultThreadPool(maxConcurrency: jobCount)`)
- `TimeTicks.ToUInt32()` API: HIGH — confirmed from SharpSnmpLib official TimeTicks class documentation
- `OperationCanceledException` exception type: MEDIUM — inferred from .NET semantics and Simetra reference; SharpSnmpLib docs silent on this

**Research date:** 2026-03-05
**Valid until:** 2026-06-05 (stable library versions; Quartz 3.15.1, SharpSnmpLib 12.5.7, .NET 9 — 90 days reasonable)
