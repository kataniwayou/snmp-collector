### v1.1 Device Simulation (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Populate OID maps for OBP and NPB devices with documentation, refine simulators to match realistic device profiles, and deploy integrated K8s simulation environment for end-to-end verification.

- [x] **Phase 11: OID Map Design and OBP Population** - Establish naming convention, decide map structure, populate OBP OIDs with docs
- [ ] **Phase 12: NPB OID Population** - Populate NPB OIDs with documentation using established conventions
- [ ] **Phase 13: Simulator Refinement** - Update both simulators for realistic OID subsets and trap behavior
- [ ] **Phase 14: K8s Integration and E2E** - Deploy simulator pods, update ConfigMap, verify end-to-end pipeline

## Phase Details

### Phase 11: OID Map Design and OBP Population
**Goal**: OID map structure is decided, naming convention is established, OBP device OIDs are populated with full documentation
**Depends on**: Phase 10 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements**: OIDM-01, OIDM-02, OIDM-03, DOC-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. OID map entries follow device-type prefix + metric + index suffix naming (e.g., `obp_link_state_L1`, `obp_r1_power_L3`) and this convention is documented
  2. Separate `oidmap-*.json` files per device type, auto-scanned at startup, merged into single runtime dictionary
  3. K8s deployment uses directory mount (no subPath) for OID map hot-reload via ConfigMap updates
  4. OBP OID map contains entries for 4 links covering state, channel, and optical power (R1-R4) with realistic OID strings
  5. Each OBP OID has documentation specifying value meaning, units, and expected ranges
**Plans**: 3 plans (complete)

### Phase 12: NPB OID Population
**Goal**: NPB device OIDs are populated with full documentation, following the naming convention and structure established in Phase 11
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: OIDM-04, DOC-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. NPB OID map contains entries for 8 ports covering system health, per-port traffic counters, and port status with realistic OID strings
  2. Each NPB OID has documentation specifying value meaning, units, and expected ranges
  3. NPB entries follow the same naming convention as OBP (e.g., `npb_port_rx_octets_P1`, `npb_port_status_P8`)
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 12-01-PLAN.md -- Create oidmap-npb.json with 68 documented entries and update K8s ConfigMaps

### Phase 13: Simulator Refinement
**Goal**: Both OBP and NPB simulators respond with realistic OID subsets matching the populated OID maps and send appropriate trap types
**Depends on**: Phase 11, Phase 12
**Requirements**: SIM-01, SIM-02, SIM-03, SIM-04, SIM-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. OBP simulator responds to SNMP GET for all 4-link OIDs defined in the OID map with realistic values
  2. OBP simulator sends StateChange traps for all 4 links with correct OID bindings
  3. NPB simulator responds to SNMP GET for all 8-port OIDs defined in the OID map with realistic values (system health + per-port traffic)
  4. NPB simulator sends link up/down traps with correct OID bindings
  5. Both simulators authenticate using `Simetra.{DeviceName}` community string convention (e.g., `Simetra.OBP-01`, `Simetra.NPB-01`)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 14: K8s Integration and E2E
**Goal**: Simulator pods are deployed in K8s, snmp-collector ConfigMap has correct MetricPoll groups for both device types, and the full pipeline works end-to-end
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: SIM-06, POLL-01, POLL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. OBP and NPB simulator pods run in the K8s cluster and are reachable by snmp-collector
  2. snmp-collector ConfigMap contains MetricPoll groups for OBP that match the OBP OID map entries
  3. snmp-collector ConfigMap contains MetricPoll groups for NPB that match the NPB OID map entries
  4. Polled OBP and NPB metrics appear in Prometheus with correct metric names and labels
  5. Traps from both simulators flow through the pipeline and produce metrics in Prometheus
**Plans**: TBD
